      <h2>What's Lettuce doing? There are logs, but structured event logs that we can query would be so much more
        powerful!</h2>
      <p>Currently, Lettuce keeps some log files, but they're only so useful. If we could keep structured logs, we can
        take user interactions and use them to improve Lettuce.</p>
      <p>We hope to store events in a database so we can check whether users accept Lettuce's suggestions for concepts,
        perhaps which concept they select instead, and maybe even get insights from how they get there.</p>
