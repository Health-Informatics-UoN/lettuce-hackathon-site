      <p>Lettuce is coming to the HDR UK and ELIXIR joint Hackathon! We've got a few parts to the project that you could
        help with. <u>The focus of the project will be to run Lettuce in a federated setting and evaluate outputs across
          nodes in the federation</u>.</p>

        The first version of this website had a "Choose your own adventure" theme, and I couldn't bear to get rid of it
        entirely, so you have to put up with some fantasy images

            Lettuce will run inside trusted research environments.
            Sometimes, users will need to keep the data they send to Lettuce private, which is why it runs locally.
            However, as Lettuce pipelines change, it would be useful for users to be able to check whether other
            deployments of Lettuce perform well on their datasets, while keeping their data private.
            Can we use BitFount's platform to run evaluations on Lettuce tasks and preserve privacy?

        <h3>Structured Event Logging</h3>
        <img src="assets/observability.jpg" width="80%"
          alt="Two robed figures working together to make a database of logs for a lettuce">
        <div class="project-details">
          <p><b>What's Lettuce doing? There are logs, but structured event logs that we can query would be so much more
              powerful!</b></p>
          <br>
          <p>Currently, Lettuce keeps some log files, but they're only so useful. If we could keep structured logs, we
            can
            take user interactions and use them to improve Lettuce.
            We hope to store events in a database so we can check whether users accept Lettuce's suggestions for
            concepts,
            perhaps which concept they select instead, and maybe even get insights from how users decide.

            All of this could be used to train later versions of Lettuce, and to improve how Lettuce can help users!</p>
