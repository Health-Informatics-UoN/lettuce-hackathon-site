        <p>Lettuce is coming to the HDR UK and ELIXIR joint Hackathon! We've got a few parts to the project that you could help with. <u>The focus of the project will be to run Lettuce in a federated setting and evaluate outputs across nodes in the federation</u>, but whether you're good at making fancy visualisations for the front-end or wrangling data on the back-end, we have projects for you!</p>

          The first version of this website had a "Choose your own adventure" theme, and I couldn't bear to get rid of it entirely, so you have to put up with some fantasy images

                  Lettuce will run inside trusted research environments.
                  Sometimes, users will need to keep the data they send to Lettuce private, which is why it runs locally.
                  However, as Lettuce pipelines change, it would be useful for users to be able to check whether other deployments of Lettuce perform well on their datasets, while keeping their data private.
                  Can we use BitFount's platform to run evaluations on Lettuce tasks and preserve privacy?

                <h3>Reciprocal Rank Fusion</h3>
                <img src="assets/reciprocal-rank-fusion.jpg" alt="An armoured figure guarding a database, fusing forces of order and chaos">
                <div class="project-details">
                  <p><b>Both vector search and string matching are useful for finding concepts. Can we get them to work together?</b></p>
                  <br>
                  <p>We have found that using similarity of text embeddings for concept names is a superior method for information
                  retrieval to string-matching approaches. That doesn't mean that string-matching is useless, however. Reciprocal
                  rank fusion uses the ranking of multiple retrieval mechanisms to combine information retrieval pipelines.
                  Conveniently, this can be <a href="https://anyblockers.com/posts/postgres-as-a-search-engine#table-with-four-legs">carried out in-database</a>,
                  and could be a useful approach to our retrieval-augmented generation pipelines.</p>

            <div class="project-card" data-project="concept-graph">
                <h3>Interactive Concept Graph</h3>
                <img src="assets/interactive-graph.jpg" width="80%" alt="A whimsical bard designing a graph interface">
                <div class="project-details">
                    <p><b>Sometimes Lettuce finds a related concept to the one we want. Can we make an interactive tool to explore a concept's local graph to find the right concept?</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In the OMOP common data model, there are two tables describing relationships between concepts, the
                    <tt>concept_relationship</tt> and <tt>concept_hierarchy</tt> tables. We have an
                    <a href="https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/omop-relationship-graph">API</a> to retrieve a concept's local
                    graph, and some javascript for visualising that graph. If you're a smarter javascript dev than the original
                    author, you could make it a useful part of Lettuce's user interface.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If a user could click on a related concept in the graph, and then is shown that concept's local graph, users
                    could explore related concepts. It could also be useful to select a desired concept.</p>

            <div class="project-card" data-project="structured-logs">
                <h3>Structured Event Logging</h3>
                <img src="assets/observability.jpg" width="80%" alt="Two robed figures working together to make a database of logs for a lettuce">
                <div class="project-details">
                  <p><b>What's Lettuce doing? There are logs, but structured event logs that we can query would be so much more powerful!</b></p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Currently, Lettuce keeps some log files, but they're only so useful. If we could keep structured logs, we can
                  take user interactions and use them to improve Lettuce.
                  We hope to store events in a database so we can check whether users accept Lettuce's suggestions for concepts,
                  perhaps which concept they select instead, and maybe even get insights from how users decide.

                  All of this could be used to train later versions of Lettuce, and to improve how Lettuce can help users!</p>
