        <p>Lettuce is coming to the HDR UK and ELIXIR joint Hackathon! We've got a few parts to the project that you could help with. <u>The focus of the project will be to run Lettuce in a federated setting and evaluate outputs across nodes in the federation</u>, but whether you're good at making fancy visualisations for the front-end or wrangling data on the back-end, we have projects for you!</p>

          The first version of this website had a "Choose your own adventure" theme, and I couldn't bear to get rid of it entirely, so you have to put up with some fantasy images

                  Lettuce will run inside trusted research environments.
                  Sometimes, users will need to keep the data they send to Lettuce private, which is why it runs locally.
                  However, as Lettuce pipelines change, it would be useful for users to be able to check whether other deployments of Lettuce perform well on their datasets, while keeping their data private.
                  Can we use BitFount's platform to run evaluations on Lettuce tasks and preserve privacy?

                    <b><p>Both vector search and string matching are useful for finding concepts. Can we get them to work together?</p></b>
                    <br>
                    <p>We have found that using similarity of text embeddings for concept names is a superior method for information retrieval to string-matching approaches. That doesn't mean that string-matching is useless, however. Reciprocal rank fusion uses the ranking of multiple retrieval mechanisms to combine information retrieval pipelines.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>In the OMOP common data model, there are two tables describing relationships between concepts. We want to create a tool that allows users to explore related concepts through an interactive graph.</p>

                    <p>Currently, Lettuce keeps some log files, but they're only so useful. We hope to store events in a database to track user interactions and improve the system.</p>
