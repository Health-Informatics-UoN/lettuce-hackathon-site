      <h2>Queries to Lettuce shouldn't return what the user asks for, but what they want. Can we augment their queries
        to get closer?</h2>
      <p>Currently, Lettuce queries the database first, then uses what it retrieves to inform the LLM. Perhaps it would
        be better to turn this on its head.</p>
      <p>Search engines have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_expansion">modified user queries</a> for a
        long time to improve information retrieval. Can we get an LLM to <a
          href="https://akash-mathur.medium.com/advanced-rag-query-augmentation-for-next-level-search-using-llamaindex-d362fed7ecc3">rewrite
          user queries</a> so that search output is
        improved? Just removing irrelevant material from self-reported medications will help short-term, but this could
        be an invaluable approach as Lettuce handles more complex input.</p>
