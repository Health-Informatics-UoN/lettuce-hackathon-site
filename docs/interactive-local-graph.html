      <h2>Sometimes Lettuce finds a related concept to the one we want. Can we make an interactive tool to explore a
        concept's local graph to find the right concept?</h2>
      <p>In the OMOP common data model, there are two tables describing relationships between concepts, the
        <tt>concept_relationship</tt> and <tt>concept_hierarchy</tt> tables. We have an <a
          href="https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/omop-relationship-graph">API</a>to retrieve a concept's local
        graph, and some javascript for visualising that graph. If you're a smarter javascript dev than the original
        author, you could make it a useful part of Lettuce's user interface.</p>
      <br>
      <p>If a user could click on a related concept in the graph, and then is shown that concept's local graph, users
        could explore related concepts. It could also be useful to select a desired concept.</p>
