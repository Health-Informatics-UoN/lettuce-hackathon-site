        <p>What's Lettuce doing? There are logs, but structured event logs that we can query would be so much more

        <p>Queries to Lettuce shouldn't return what the user asks for, but what they want. Can we augment their queries
          to get closer?</p>

        <p>Sometimes Lettuce finds a related concept to the one we want. Can we make an interactive tool to explore a
          concept's local graph to find the right concept?</p>
