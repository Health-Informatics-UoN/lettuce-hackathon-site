      First, we've made a minimal Lettuce setup which you can clone from <a
        href="https://github.com/health-informatics-uon/lettuce-inspector">here</a>.
      There are a couple of examples of how to run pipelines in this way in <tt>/examples</tt>.
      <br>
      The code in the repository assumes you have a vector database, and the OMOP vocabularies in a sqlite database.
      The .zip archive of the vector database should be unzipped into <tt>/chroma_db</tt> so that the repo's directory
      has <tt>/chroma_db/chroma_db.sqlite</tt> and auxiliary files.
      The OMOP vocabs database should be copied into the top-level directory of lettuce-inspector.
      <br>
      The vector database contains embeddings, but only for concepts that are Drugs and standard OMOP concepts.
      You would not believe how hard I worked to make a vector database that I could share as a file, and a limitation
      of what I arrived at is that we can only have a limited set of concept embeddings.
